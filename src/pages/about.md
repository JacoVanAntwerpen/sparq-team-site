SPARQ is a techno-economic analysis team specialising in renewable fuels and green metals. We combine rigorous modelling with pragmatic advisory to help industry scale and governments plan.

We focus on feasibility-to-roadmap delivery, dynamic TEAâ€“LCA, NSW-relevant geospatial insights, and policy-linked, investment-grade analysis that de-risks commercialisation.
