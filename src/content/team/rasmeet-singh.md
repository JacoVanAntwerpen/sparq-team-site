longSummary: Rasmeet's project focuses on the commercial maturity of Power-to-X
  (P2X) technologies, which utilize renewable energy to convert abundant
  molecules like water, CO2, and N2 into green energy carriers, fuels, and
  chemical feedstocks. The project aims to develop advanced TEA models and
  open-source tools to assess the economic and environmental feasibility of
  various P2X pathways. Key objectives include optimizing these tools for
  scalability and application in sectors like mining, aviation, and maritime,
  identifying knowledge gaps, and fostering collaboration between academia and
  industry. By evaluating economic drivers and environmental impact, this
  research will provide valuable insights for the large-scale adoption of P2X
  technologies for deep-rooted decarbonization.
