  I am a PhD candidate at UNSW, having completed my Master of Science in Sustainable Energy Systems Management at Hanze University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands. My master's thesis focused on the technoeconomics of synthetic methane production from renewable energy and atmospheric carbon dioxide. With expertise in energy system design, analysis, and optimization, as well as economic and environmental assessment, I am passionate about advocating for sustainable energy systems and advancing the global energy transition toward a sustainable future.  


  Given the importance of hydrogen in the energy transition, my research focuses on assessing the environmental impacts of large-scale green hydrogen production with respect to planetary boundaries. Through this work, I am aiming to contribute to the development of sustainable energy systems and help pave the way for a more sustainable future.
