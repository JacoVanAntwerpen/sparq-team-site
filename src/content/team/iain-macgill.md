  Prof. Iain MacGill is a Professor at the School of Electrical Engineering and
  Telecommunications at the University of New South Wales, and Joint Director
  (Engineering) for the University’s Collaboration on Energy and Environmental
  Markets (CEEM). He leads work in two of CEEM’s three research areas –
  Sustainable Energy Transformation including energy technology assessment and
  renewable energy integration, and Distributed Energy Systems including ‘smart
  grids’ and ‘smart’ homes, distributed generation, and demand-side
  participation. He also has research interests in energy and climate policy.


  He has run industry short courses and consulted to industry and government clients in these areas both in Australia and internationally. He is the Responsible Australian Expert on the International Energy Agency’s PV Power Systems Task 14 on high PV penetrations in the electricity grid and an invited expert for the technical reference groups of the Federal Government’s Australian Energy Technology Assessment, the Australian Energy Market Operator’s future energy scenarios planning process and, previously, the Australian Energy Market Commission’s Demand-Side Participation Review. Iain has a PhD (Electrical Engineering) from UNSW, and a M.Eng.Sc. (Biomedical) and B.E. from the University of Melbourne. Former roles include ‘smart control systems’ consulting in the Australian Mining and Mineral Processing industry, and several years in Washington DC as a senior policy analyst in the environmental NGO sector. CEEM itself undertakes interdisciplinary research in the analysis and design of energy and environmental markets and their associated policy frameworks. It brings together researchers from five UNSW Faculties with project funding from partners including the Australian Federal Government, CSIRO, State Governments, and industry.
