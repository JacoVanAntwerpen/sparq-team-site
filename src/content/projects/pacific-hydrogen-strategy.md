  ## Overview


  The Pacific Hydrogen Strategy is a regionally coordinated initiative, led by Australia’s Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW), in collaboration with UNSW Sydney, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Pacific Community (SPC), and the University of the South Pacific (USP). It responds to the Efate Outcome Statement from the 2023 Fifth Pacific Regional Energy and Transport Ministers’ Meeting (Port Vila), which underscored the transformative potential of green hydrogen and its derivatives in decarbonising the Pacific Islands.


  ## Project Outputs


  The project will deliver a series of analytical reports and tools designed to lay the groundwork for a hydrogen‑enabled future across Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs): 


  **Report A:** Explores the overarching case for adopting green hydrogen and derivatives in the PICTs, including an overview of renewable energy resources (solar, wind, bioenergy), energy demand by sector, and national energy commitments.


  **Report B:** Assesses current and emerging hydrogen technologies within the Pacific context using a multi‑criteria techno‑economic framework.


  **Report C:** Maps resource availability (e.g., renewable potential, land, infrastructure) and formulates techno‑economic projections for hydrogen value chains in the Pacific.


  **Report D:** Synthesises findings from A–C to construct a robust "Pacific Hydrogen Roadmap" with economic projections and scenario modelling, underpinned by an open‑source assessment tool.


  **Open-source Tools:** A suite of excel based tools that were used as part of the study from production through to end use. 


  ## Key Objectives


  Equip the PICTs with rigorous data and actionable plans for meaningful hydrogen deployment.

  Foster regional capacity in hydrogen technology, feasibility analysis, and policy development.

  Accelerate progress toward decarbonisation, energy security, and alignment with global net-zero goals.
