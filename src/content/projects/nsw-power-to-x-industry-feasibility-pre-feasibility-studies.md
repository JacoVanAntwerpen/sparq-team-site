  ## Overview


  The NSW P2X studies are industry pre-feasibility and feasibility studies delivering techno-economic analysis of NSW’s capability and capacity to deploy P2X hubs and develop future industries. The studies synthesise a broad range of data, research and industry information to provide a systemic view of P2X development pathways.


  ## NSW P2X Pre-Feasibility Study


  This report investigated NSW’s opportunities and capabilities to establish P2X industries. The study’s objective was to assess the technological pathways of different P2X industries and identify prospective locations for large-scale P2X production in NSW.


  ## NSW P2X Industry Feasibility Study


  This study builds on findings from the P2X Pre-Feasibility Study to deliver a comprehensive assessment of the technical and economic viability of NSW P2X hubs, particularly on green hydrogen, considering production costs, transportation costs and supply chains to existing and future markets.


  ## Project Outputs & Highlights


  **Pre‑Feasibility Study** (2021): Offers an initial evidence‑based evaluation of P2X technologies, identifying scalable production opportunities and ideal locations across NSW, and proposes a detailed roadmap to unlock economic and decarbonisation benefits.


  **Feasibility Study** (2023): Expands upon the pre‑feasibility findings with a robust techno‑economic assessment of potential P2X hubs, examining production and transport costs, supply chain viability, and target markets for green hydrogen and derivatives.


  **NSW Powerfuel Value Chain Tool**: This user friendly online modelling platform enables stakeholders (investors, industry and researchers) to conduct their own site- and product specific feasibility analysis. 


  ## Key Objectives


  1. Map technological pathways and regional opportunities for green fuel production. 

  2. Identify optimal NSW locations for P2X industrial facilities.  

  3. Develop an actionable roadmap to drive economic development and decarbonisation.  

  4. Promote innovation and stakeholder collaboration via PFH2N and the Decarbonisation Innovation Hub.


  ## Impact


  These studies position NSW to:


  * Create regional employment and grow clean-energy industries.  

  * Accelerate progress toward net-zero emissions by 2050.  

  * Offer transparency and open tools to empower investors, researchers, and policymakers.
