title: Opportunity for Developing an e-SAF Value Chain in NSW
shortDescription: This pre-feasibility study assesses the potential for
  developing a synthetic Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF) industry in New South
  Wales by evaluating strategic e-SAF hub locations, production pathways, and
  market opportunities to support aviation sector decarbonisation.

  ## Overview


  Commissioned under the NSW Powerfuels including Hydrogen Network (PFHN) with support from the NSW Office of the Chief Scientist & Engineer (OCSE), this study explores the feasibility of importing and producing e-SAF in NSW. It identifies the state’s strategic advantages such as abundant renewable energy, accessible CO₂ sources, and proximity to major aviation hubs like Sydney Airport and assesses potential e-SAF production hubs using the P2X Hub and Precinct Framework. The report combines technical analysis, stakeholder consultation, and cost modeling to highlight NSW’s capacity to pioneer a low-carbon aviation industry. It outlines the production process of e-SAF utilising renewable hydrogen and captured CO₂, addresses challenges such as high upfront costs, and recommends industrial R&D alliances, policy incentives (e.g., mandates, tax support), and public–private partnerships to scale up industry viability.


  ## Objectives & Scope


  The primary objective is to understand and map NSW’s capabilities in hosting an e-SAF production industry from feedstock and energy supply through to market demand and infrastructure readiness. The study scopes technical feasibility, economic outlook, and site suitability for e-SAF hubs, while providing a preliminary blueprint for action.


  ## Funding / Partners


  The project was conducted by UNSW under the PFHN, with support from the NSW OCSE, as part of the NSW Decarbonisation Innovation Hub initiatives.


  ## Impact & Significance


  This study lays critical groundwork for establishing a domestic e-SAF industry, highlighting how NSW could reduce aviation emissions, generate economic value through green jobs, and leverage its infrastructure and energy advantage. It proposes strategic interventions to drive adoption, positioning NSW as a national leader in aviation decarbonisation innovation.
