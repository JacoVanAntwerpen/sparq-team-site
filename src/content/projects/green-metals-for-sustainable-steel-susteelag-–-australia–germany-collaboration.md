title: Green Metals for Sustainable Steel (SuSteelAG) – Australia–Germany
  Collaboration
shortDescription: A feasibility and technical study led by UNSW to explore the
  creation of a sustainable green iron and steel value chain between Australia
  and Germany. It examines pathways for decarbonising steel production using
  green hydrogen and iron/steel export opportunities.

  ## Overview


  The SuSteelAG initiative is a joint project between Australia's Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) and Germany’s Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Led by UNSW Sydney, the study investigates the feasibility of establishing a low-carbon green iron and steel value chain across both countries.


  This project builds on the UNSW-led HySupply study and progresses in three key report phases:


  1. **The Case for an Australian Green Iron and Steel Supply Chain to Germany** – identifies strategic opportunities.

  2. **Technological Pathways for a Green Iron and Green Steel Supply Chain** – explores production technologies.

  3. **Techno-economic Assessment of a Green Iron and Steel Value Chain** – evaluates economic feasibility.


  The initiative leverages Australia’s abundant iron ore and renewable energy resources to support Germany’s decarbonisation ambitions while creating pathways for industrial collaboration and sustainable export markets.


  ## Key Objectives & Scope


  The central aim of SuSteelAG is to assess the feasibility of building a new green metals export industry that connects Australia’s renewable resources and iron ore base with Germany’s steel sector. The project explores the technical pathways for green iron and steel production, evaluates the economic competitiveness of different options, and identifies opportunities for both countries to collaborate on industrial decarbonisation. By combining rigorous technical analysis with policy and market insights, the study provides a roadmap for how such a supply chain could be realised in practice.


  ## Funding / Partners


  SuSteelAG is funded jointly by the Australian and German governments, with DCCEEW and BMBF providing support to ensure the project is both scientifically robust and strategically relevant. UNSW Sydney leads the Australian contribution, drawing on expertise in chemical engineering, energy systems, and mining, while working closely with German research organisations and industry stakeholders.


  ## Impact and Significance


  By linking Australia’s renewable energy potential and iron ore resources with Germany’s industrial demand, SuSteelAG demonstrates how green hydrogen and green steel can underpin a new era of sustainable trade. The project’s findings will help position Australia as a global supplier of low-carbon metals, while supporting Germany’s commitment to decarbonising heavy industry. Beyond economic opportunities, the collaboration sets a precedent for how international partnerships can accelerate the development of new value chains that reduce emissions, create jobs, and contribute to the global energy transition.
