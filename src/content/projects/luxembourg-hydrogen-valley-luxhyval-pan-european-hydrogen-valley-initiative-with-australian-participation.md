title: "Luxembourg Hydrogen Valley (LuxHyVal): Pan-European Hydrogen Valley
  Initiative with Australian Participation"
shortDescription: LuxHyVal is a flagship five-year Horizon Europe project
  establishing a green hydrogen valley in Luxembourg, integrating green hydrogen
  production, storage, distribution, and end-use in mobility and industry.

  ## Overview


  LuxHyVal, also referred to as the Luxembourg Hydrogen Valley, is a large-scale initiative funded under Horizon Europe and coordinated by the University of Luxembourg. Launched in June 2024, the project aims to shift Luxembourg from imported grey hydrogen toward a fully integrated, locally produced green hydrogen ecosystem. Centered around a 6 MW electrolyser facility in Bascharage, the demonstration valley will produce up to 1,750 kg/day of green hydrogen to serve both mobility (fuel cell buses) and industrial users (notably replacing natural gas-derived hydrogen in high-tech manufacturing).


  The project spans the full hydrogen value chain (production, storage, distribution, and utilization) while also addressing safety, business model development, regulatory frameworks, digital twinning for operational optimization, public acceptance, workforce upskilling, and replication in two ‘follower valleys’ planned in the Czech Republic and Ukraine. It is backed by a €39 million budget, of which approximately €8 million is contributed by the EU’s Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking.


  ## Team / Contributors


  The consortium comprises 17–19 partners from seven countries, including academic institutions, energy firms, infrastructure partners, technology providers, and industry users. The University of Luxembourg leads coordination, supported by partners like Paul Wurth, Encevo, Enovos, LuxEnergie, university collaborators from Europe, and UNSW (Australia) as the Australian research lead.


  ## Objectives & Scope


  The primary objective is to create a fully-operational green hydrogen valley that serves as a replicable model across Europe. LuxHyVal seeks to demonstrate technical feasibility and develop viable business models, regulatory approaches, and social engagement strategies for hydrogen ecosystems. By integrating production to utilization, the project addresses hard-to-abate sectors including public transport and industry. It contributes to Luxembourg’s decarbonisation and supports EU emissions targets while fostering innovation and professional capacity in hydrogen technologies.


  ## Funding / Partners


  LuxHyVal is funded through Horizon Europe under the Clean Hydrogen Partnership, with a total budget of approximately €39 million and €8 million from EU sources. The initiative combines public and private funding from energy providers, industrial partners, and research institutions across multiple countries.


  ## Timeline


  The project officially launched in June 2024 and will run for about five years, with a projected conclusion in early 2029. 


  ## Impact & Significance


  LuxHyVal represents a high-impact demonstration of green hydrogen’s potential to decarbonise critical sectors at a regional scale. The project’s comprehensive framework—from digital twin operations to public acceptance strategies—offers a robust blueprint for hydrogen valley replication. For Australia and UNSW, the collaboration enhances global research reach and strengthens partnerships within the European hydrogen innovation ecosystem.
