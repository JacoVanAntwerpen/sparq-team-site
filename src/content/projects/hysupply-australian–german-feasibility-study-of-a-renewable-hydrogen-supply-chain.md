title: "HySupply: Australian–German Feasibility Study of a Renewable Hydrogen
  Supply Chain"
shortDescription: A two-year feasibility study (Nov 2020–Jan 2023) exploring the
  technical, economic, regulatory, and logistical viability of exporting
  renewable hydrogen (and its derivatives) from Australia to Germany.
longDetails: >-
  ## Overview


  HySupply was a landmark two-year feasibility study (2020–2023) jointly undertaken by Australian and German partners to investigate the viability of establishing a renewable hydrogen export corridor between Australia and Germany. The project examined the full supply chain: from large-scale hydrogen production using renewable energy in Australia, through conversion and transport (including derivatives such as ammonia and methanol), to delivery and utilisation in Germany’s energy system.


  The study assessed technical pathways, economic competitiveness, regulatory frameworks, certification standards, and policy alignment. It demonstrated that Australia is well-positioned to become a reliable hydrogen supplier, and highlighted the role of derivatives and certification schemes in enabling early trade. HySupply also provided government and industry with a roadmap for scaling up supply chains, identifying barriers, and supporting collaboration through initiatives like HyGATE.


  ## Outputs


  **Final Joint Report:** The capstone document of the HySupply project, presenting comprehensive findings on the technical, economic, and regulatory feasibility of renewable hydrogen trade between Australia and Germany. It consolidates insights from earlier studies and outlines strategic recommendations for governments and industry to enable commercial supply chains by 2030.


  **Supply-Side Roadmapping Report:** A detailed assessment of Australia’s hydrogen production and export potential, highlighting infrastructure requirements, investment needs, and critical barriers. The roadmap identifies opportunities for scaling up supply and provides guidance for policymakers on how to accelerate project deployment and reduce risks.


  **Certification Report:** An in-depth exploration of certification challenges and solutions for green hydrogen and its derivatives. It proposes bilateral frameworks for guarantees of origin, ensuring that hydrogen produced in Australia can be credibly recognised as renewable in Germany, aligning with emerging EU standards.


  **State of Play Report:** An early-stage analysis that set the foundation for the HySupply project. This report examined Australia’s renewable energy resources, Germany’s demand outlook, and potential trade dynamics, establishing the business case for a future hydrogen export market.


  **Cost & Shipping Tools:** A suite of open-source Excel-based models developed during HySupply to evaluate hydrogen production costs, transport logistics, and carrier competitiveness. Tools include modules for liquefied hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and shipping pathways, enabling scenario analysis for researchers and industry stakeholders.


  **Workshops & Delegations:** A series of bilateral engagement activities, including German delegation visits to Australia, technical workshops, and stakeholder consultations. These events built trust, disseminated findings, and fostered collaboration between government, academia, and industry across both countries.


  ## Partners & Collaborators:


  **Australia:** UNSW Sydney (lead), GlobH2E, CSIRO, Deloitte, Baringa Partners, GPA Engineering, Scimita Ventures.


  **Germany:** acatech (German Academy of Science & Engineering), BDI (Federation of German Industries), IKEM (Institute for Climate Protection, Energy and Mobility).


  **Government Support:** Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).


  ## Funding / Support


  AUD $523,000 provided by DFAT for the Australian consortium.


  Approx. €1.7 million from BMBF for German partners.


  ## Status / Timeline


  **Launched:** November 2020


  **Final Joint Report & Conclusion:** January 2023


  **Outcomes:** Recommendations now informing bilateral HyGATE program and ongoing Australia–Germany hydrogen collaboration.
