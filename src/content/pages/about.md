title: About SPARQ
---
SPARQ is a techno-economic analysis and advisory group dedicated to accelerating the transition toward low-carbon energy and materials. We combine rigorous modelling with strategic insight to help industry, government, and investors navigate uncertainty and act with confidence. Our work bridges research, policy, and commercialisation. Turning innovative ideas into investable projects.

## Low-Carbon Liquid Fuels

We specialise in analysing pathways for sustainable fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable diesel, methanol, ammonia and synthetic natural gas. By combining process engineering, techno-economic modelling, and market analysis, we provide a clear picture of costs, scalability, and infrastructure requirements. This work supports industrial users, fuel producers, and governments in developing resilient supply chains and investment strategies.

## Green Metals

Decarbonising metals such as steel and aluminium is central to achieving net-zero goals. At SPARQ, we investigate decarbonisation pathways for green metals production, assessing their techno-economic feasibility and environmental impact. Our modelling helps industries and policymakers evaluate technology readiness, feedstock requirements, and investment opportunities in emerging green metals value chains.

## Roadmaps and Decarbonisation Strategies

We design sector-specific roadmaps that chart the course toward deep decarbonisation. These strategies balance economic realities with ambitious climate goals, offering stakeholders a clear pathway from feasibility to deployment. Our roadmaps integrate techno-economic results with infrastructure planning, ensuring that investment decisions are both technically sound and aligned with long-term transition targets.

## Policy and Market Design

Effective decarbonisation requires supportive policy frameworks. SPARQ brings deep experience in analysing and shaping energy policy, market mechanisms, and regulatory environments. We provide evidence-based insights to guide the creation of incentive schemes, certification systems, and market structures that unlock private capital while ensuring alignment with national and regional climate strategies.

## Supporting Commercialisation

Our role extends beyond analysis. We actively support the commercialisation of emerging technologies. By delivering feasibility studies, front-end engineering support, and risk assessments, we help innovators secure funding, attract partners, and move from concept to deployment. This ensures that promising technologies are not just theoretically viable but positioned for real-world impact.

## Government and Stakeholder Engagement

The SPARQ team works closely with government agencies, industry consortia, and international partners to align research with practical decision-making. Through collaborative modelling, workshops, and policy advisory, we help ensure that decarbonisation pathways are shaped by both rigorous analysis and stakeholder input. Our work strengthens the connection between science, policy, and implementation.

## Open-Source Tools and Knowledge Sharing

We are committed to transparency and collaboration. SPARQ develops and shares open-source modelling frameworks and techno-economic analysis tools, enabling broader engagement with decarbonisation pathways. By making these resources accessible, we aim to support a growing ecosystem of researchers, practitioners, and policymakers working toward a sustainable future.
